v0.1: Hello Wrlod!

The idea of Swatcheroo is to create a tool to make Inkscape / GIMP color swatches in your browser.
The current implementation consists of a plain html file with embedded svg to demonstrate the idea. 
It works.

v0.2 TODO:
- load, read svg xml from remote URL using <input>
- make xmlhttp request to load uploaded svg into html page
- analyze colors, display resulting .gpl in html page

v0.3 TODO:
- add simple server enabling user to upload svg
- make xmlhttp request to load uploaded svg into html page
- make interface to display .gpl next to detected colors
- make .gpl downloadable
